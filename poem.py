After all that I've said till now,
I still find myself short on words somehow.
Canâ€™t help but wonder when and where,
Two starry minds found this bond so rare. ðŸŒŒ<br>

From just some casual in-game chats,
To being mirrorsâ€”reflecting facts.
Calling out flaws, but with gentle care,
Helping each other steer clear of despair.

It wasnâ€™t just fate or passing chance,
That pulled us into this shared expanse.
Some stars aligned, in a quiet way,
And wrote this friendship into play. âœ¨

You talk with heart, no masks, no games,
Just honesty running through your veins.
So rare it feels, so clean, so trueâ€”
I trust the world a bit more, 'cause of you.

You call me senpai, and I chuckle inside,
Your respect is loud, no need to hide.
And yet we banter, like little kids,
Trading chaos and sussy skits. ðŸ˜†

From 3AM talks that wander and flow,
To quiet times where no words showâ€”
Iâ€™ve found a peace in you, a light,
That makes even darkest nights feel right. ðŸŒ™

So hereâ€™s to you, Abhiâ€”my constant star,
The best person I've got, by far.
On your birthday, I hope you see,
How much your presence means to me. ðŸŽ‚ðŸ’«
